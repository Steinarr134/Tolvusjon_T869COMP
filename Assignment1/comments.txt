The processing time, reading and displaying one image is to small to be properly detected by python's built in time measurements.


Adding the bright spot detection slows down the processing.
The double for loop slows it all the way down to 10 FPS.
However by using either Numpy's argmax or opencv's MinMaxLoc functions brings
the processing time back down into non measureable levels.


The latency is very little when using the built in web camera on the laptop being used.
However when using an Android phone to act as a hotspot and IP camera things get a lot worse.

When running the for loop to find the bright spot,
python isn't quick enough to request the next frame that the frames just
build up in a buffer somewhere and the latency gets worse and worse.

However when python is quick enough the latency feels like approximately one second.
